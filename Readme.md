# Rode Clone

- I created a homepage for RODE that is an exact replica of the homepage for the company's official website. 
- I used Tailwind CSS, HTML, and a little bit of CSS to create this project. 
- It is fully responsive for all screen sizes.

- It took me around **6 hour** to complete the project.
